# Business Site

This week's project was to create a business website that contains and image/video header, a signup form and an accordian. Focus was to apply what we have learned about backgrounds, HTML forms and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. 

## The problem

Again in this second week i had problems with html form and css. Less then the week before but still struggling with that. If i had more time would like to add more elements in HTML and play more with styling. Especially styling the form and buttons.
